All projects are to be completed using Microsoft (MS) Excel.

## Sampling
**Objective:** Students will be able to use MS Excel to obtain simple random samples from a large population.

- Use the `Davis data set` to complete project 1.  

**About Davis Data Set (Self-Reports of Height and Weight)**

The Davis data frame (Self-Reports of Height and Weight) has 200 rows and 5 columns. The subjects were men and women engaged in regular exercise. There are some missing data. After removing all missing data, the data frame now has 181 rows and 5 columns. 

This data frame contains the following columns:
- `sex A` factor with levels: F, female; M, male.
- `weight` Measured weight in kg.
- `height` Measured height in cm.
- `repwt` Reported weight in kg.
- `repht` Reported height in cm.

## Descriptive Statistics

**Objective:** Students will be able to use MS Excel and descriptive tools to summarize and describe basic features/characteristics of data. This project is a continuation of the sampling project.

## Inferential Statistics

**Objective:** Students will be able to use MS Excel, random samples, and an inferential tool to draw conclusion about a population parameter.
