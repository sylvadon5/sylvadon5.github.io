### About IPUMS NHIS
NHIS (https://nhis.ipums.org/nhis) is a harmonized set of data covering more than 50 years (1963-present) of the NHIS. The NHIS is the principal source of information on the health of the U.S. population, covering such topics as general health status, the distribution of acute and chronic illness, functional limitations, access to and use of medical services, insurance coverage, and health behaviors (such as exercise, diet, and tobacco and alcohol consumption). 

**Definition of Variables**

- REGION: Region of residence
- AGE: Age in years 
- SEX: Sex
- POVLEV:  Ratio of family income to poverty threshold
- HEALTH: Health status
- BMICAT: Categorical body mass index
- DIABTYPE: Type of diabetes
- HYP2TIME: Ever told had hypertension on 2+ visits 

 














## Sampling
**Objective(s):** Students will be able to use MS Excel to obtain simple random samples from a large population.

**About Davis Data Set (Self-Reports of Height and Weight)**

The Davis data frame (Self-Reports of Height and Weight) has 200 rows and 5 columns. The subjects were men and women engaged in regular exercise. There are some missing data. After removing all missing data, the data frame now has 181 rows and 5 columns. 

This data frame contains the following columns:
- `sex A` factor with levels: F, female; M, male.
- `weight` Measured weight in kg.
- `height` Measured height in cm.
- `repwt` Reported weight in kg.
- `repht` Reported height in cm.
